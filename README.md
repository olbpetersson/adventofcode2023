## Installing
This repo uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) so you should experience a very high speed development experience. To install bun the easiest method is just to `npm install`:

```bash
npm install -g bun
```
Or just install via `curl`:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
You can check other methods in their website.

### Running
I recommend using `watch mode` to run your code. Example:

```bash
bun ./src/day1/part1.ts --watch
```
